# ðŸ“¶ 5G for low income families

Our goal is to deploy thousands of hotspots throughout the city of Miami, creating a seamless and highly efficient network that is accessible to everyone. We believe that by providing low-cost 5G and IoT services, we can help bridge the digital divide and provide internet access to low-income families.

We are looking to partner with the city of Miami, and we ask Mayor Francis Suarez to provide DeWiCats with locations throughout the city to deploy these hotspots. In return, we will offer free 5G services to low-income families by setting up helium ESIMs using a portion of the mint sale. This will allow these families to access the internet, stay connected, and access critical resources.
