Welcome!

## What is DeWiCats?

DeWiCats is an innovative NFT project that stands out by being backed by helium hotspots. On the day of minting, a total of 2000 DeWiCats will come into existence. Subsequently, a new DeWiCat will be born every day. The ownership of a DeWiCat grants you membership to an exclusive private club.

To make the minting process smoother, DeWiCats will be created using HNT and will feature a unique DAO user interface powered by SPL Governance, which is the first of its kind. Furthermore, DeWiCats will pave the way as the first DAO on Solana that is accessible through web 2.0.

We have designed a sustainable financial model for DeWiCats. Our treasury serves a crucial purpose: to enable every DeWiCat owner to propose and vote on ideas centered around DePin (Decentralized infrastructure) and secure funding for those ideas. The treasury will be the source of funds for these initiatives.

In addition, our treasury will have an infinite fund of mining rewards that continuously flows in from our miners. Moreover, whenever someone purchases a DeWiCat, a portion of the minting costs will be directly contributed to the treasury.

By purchasing a DeWiCat, you are not merely acquiring a profile picture (PFP). You are also supporting the Helium Network, the vibrant DeWiCats community, and the DAO. We have elevated the concept of NFTs to a whole new level, empowering DeWiCat owners to actively shape and fund DePin-related ideas.

### How are we deploying? <a href="#who-runs-olympus-1" id="who-runs-olympus-1"></a>

Day 1 DeWiCats will have about 25+ helium hotspots already deployed and about 50 million mobile tokens in the treasury ready to be disbursed among the holders.
