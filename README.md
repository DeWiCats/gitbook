Welcome!

## What is DeWiCats?

DeWiCats are a set of 10,000 utility-enabled, rarity-powered PFPs that offer a wide range of unique traits. Owning a DeWiCat grants you membership to a private club and more perks the longer you hold onto it. Additionally, DeWiCats are the first collection to reward holders with Helium Tokens. When you purchase a DeWiCat, you're not just getting a PFP, you're supporting the Helium Network, the DeWiCats community and the DAO. We've taken NFTs to the next level.

### What is the point of DeWiCats? <a href="#what-is-the-point-of-palmtree" id="what-is-the-point-of-palmtree"></a>

We aim to make it easier for people who want to join helium hotspot deployments, without the hassle of setting up and maintaining a hotspot. Our solution is **DeWiCats**, an NFT project that utilizes a network of hotspots powered by the people. If you own a **DeWiCat**, you have the power to vote on the deployment locations of hotspots and how rewards should be distributed.

### How do I participate in DeWiCats? <a href="#how-do-i-participate-in-olympus" id="how-do-i-participate-in-olympus"></a>

To participate in DeWiCats all you have to do is own a DeWiCat NFT. Those that hold **DeWiCats** in their wallet will automatically be given voting rights on any **DeWiCats** proposal.

### How can I benefit from DeWiCats? <a href="#how-can-i-benefit-from-olympus" id="how-can-i-benefit-from-olympus"></a>

The main benefit for holders of **DeWiCats** comes from mining rewards.&#x20;

### Who created DeWiCats? <a href="#who-created-olympus" id="who-created-olympus"></a>

Our team originates from the DeFi Community. **Peroni**(Luis Perrone), who works as a Senior Engineer on the Apps Team at **Nova Labs**, is the **founde**r. **Marcial Cabrera,** the **web lead** who has contributed to the DeWiCats frontend, currently holds a Senior Engineer position at **UKG**.

### Who runs DeWiCats? <a href="#who-runs-olympus" id="who-runs-olympus"></a>

To start we plan to give all DeWiCat holders equal voting power and plan to add helium tokens as additional ways to increase your voting power.

### How are we deploying? <a href="#who-runs-olympus-1" id="who-runs-olympus-1"></a>

Day 1 DeWiCats will have about 25 helium hotspots already deployed and about 50 million mobile tokens in the treasury ready to be disbursed among the holders. These first 50 million mobile tokens are called the genesis periods. Only early holders will benefit from this. Afterwards, rewards will only come from hotspots in the DAO.

### How will rewards work?

DeWiCats split of mining rewards will be distributed evenly among all holders everyday and need to be redeemed via the DeWiCats dApp.

### How does the split work?

DeWiCats will need to have contract deals with businesses or possibly government owned buildings. These splits could differ from business to business. Ideally the split would look like this: 1/3 to the business, 1/3 to DeWiCats DAO, 1/3 to the founders

### Where do secondary royalties go?

\- 1% Helium Foundation

\- 1% DeWiCats DAO

\- 3% Founders\
